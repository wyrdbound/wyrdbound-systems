# GRIMOIRE Engine Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our bottom-up, feature-isolated testing approach for the GRIMOIRE engine. The strategy focuses on building confidence through systematic testing of core functionality, starting with basic features and gradually expanding to more complex use cases.

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Start with fundamental components and2. **Improved SystemLoader**: Better field parsing and validation
- ✅ **Architecture Validation**: Confirmed hybrid dictionary/object approach
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust handling of malformed input
- ✅ **Entry Type Validation**: TDD implementation with comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Enhanced Table System**: Advanced entry type functionality with type overrides and generation support
- ✅ **Terminology Consistency**: Unified `type` field usage across table system
- ✅ **Execution Engine Enhancement**: Table executor supports complex entry formats and type resolutionld upward
- **Feature Isolation**: Test individual features in isolation before integration
- **Minimal Test Systems**: Use purpose-built minimal systems rather than complex real-world examples
- **Gradual Complexity**: Expand from simple use cases to complex scenarios
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure all GRIMOIRE specification features are tested

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Clear Dependencies**: Each phase builds on the previous, creating a clear dependency chain
2. **Fast Feedback**: Small, focused tests provide rapid feedback on changes
3. **Easy Debugging**: Isolated features make it easier to identify and fix issues
4. **Specification Validation**: Tests serve as executable specification documentation
5. **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive test suite prevents breaking existing functionality

---

### ✅ Phase 1.2: Model Definition Tests

**Status**: COMPLETED (26/26 tests passing, 2 skipped)

**Objective**: Comprehensive testing of model definition functionality

**Test Coverage**:

- All GRIMOIRE attribute types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `roll`, `list`, `map`
- Attribute constraints: ranges, enums, defaults
- Model inheritance via `extends`
- Validation rules and derived attributes
- Optional attributes and edge cases
- Model references and collections
- Error handling for malformed models
- **Validation rule parsing and structure**
- **Basic validation execution (type checking, range validation)**
- **Derived attribute handling (not required in instances)**

**Key Achievements**:

- Enhanced `AttributeDefinition` class with missing `of` and `optional` fields
- Updated SystemLoader to parse all specification fields
- Validated complete model definition functionality
- Established patterns for complex attribute testing

**Tests Added**: 26 tests across 6 test classes

- `TestBasicModelLoading`: 2 tests
- `TestAttributeTypes`: 7 tests
- `TestModelInheritance`: 4 tests
- `TestValidationRules`: 3 tests
- `TestValidationExecution`: 5 tests (NEW)
- `TestModelLoadingEdgeCases`: 3 tests
- `TestModelBuilderUtility`: 2 tests

**Architecture Decisions**:

- **Kept AttributeDefinition class**: Provides type safety, validation, and IDE support over simple dictionaries
- **Hybrid approach**: YAML uses dictionaries, loader converts to structured objects
- **Comprehensive field support**: Added `of` and `optional` fields to match specification

**Critical Fixes**:

- Added missing `of` field for list/map element types
- Added missing `optional` field for nullable attributes
- Updated SystemLoader attribute parsing
- Fixed test access patterns for AttributeDefinition objects
- **Fixed derived attribute handling**: Derived attributes are no longer required in instance validation
- **Enhanced validation format**: Updated specification to use `expression` + `message` format for better documentation
- **DISCOVERED: Derived attributes are fully implemented**: Investigation revealed that derived attributes work correctly via `DerivedFieldManager` and `ObservableValue` classes with automatic reactive updates

**Objective**: Test actual flow execution and output validation (building on Phase 1.4's definition testing)

#### Identified Gap (RESOLVED):

Phase 1.4 successfully tested **flow definition structure** (parsing, validation, cross-references) but revealed a critical gap: **we don't test actual flow execution**. Our current tests validate that flows are defined correctly but don't verify that:

- ✅ Flows can be defined and parsed correctly
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Flows actually execute and produce correct outputs
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Actions like `set_value` actually update the intended paths
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Table rolls actually select entries from tables
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Variables are updated correctly during execution

#### Test Coverage (COMPLETED):

1. **Flow Execution** (4 tests): ✅ Run flows end-to-end and verify successful completion

   - ✅ Basic flow execution with simple completion steps
   - ✅ Dice flow execution with proper variable updates
   - ✅ Table flow execution with output value setting
   - ✅ Choice flow execution with conditional branching

2. **Output Validation** (3 tests): ✅ Verify outputs are set correctly after execution

   - ✅ `outputs.character.name` is set correctly after table-flow execution
   - ✅ `outputs.character.class` is set correctly after choice-flow execution
   - ✅ Multiple outputs are handled correctly in complex flows

3. **Variable Updates** (3 tests): ✅ Verify variables are updated during execution

   - ✅ `variables.dice_result` is set correctly after dice-flow execution
   - ✅ `variables.ability_scores` are populated correctly after dice sequence
   - ✅ Variables persist across multiple steps in a flow

4. **Action Execution** (4 tests): ✅ Verify actions perform their intended operations

   - ✅ `set_value` actions update paths correctly
   - ✅ Multiple actions in a single step execute in order
   - ✅ Template rendering works correctly in action values
   - ✅ Error handling for invalid paths or values

5. **Step Integration** (3 tests): ✅ Verify steps work correctly with system components

   - ✅ Table roll steps actually select entries from loaded tables
   - ✅ Results match expected table entry types and formats
   - ✅ Cross-references between flows and tables work during execution

6. **Execution Context** (2 tests): ✅ Verify proper execution environment setup
   - ✅ Input parameters are correctly passed to flow execution
   - ✅ Execution context maintains proper state throughout flow

#### Technical Achievements:

- ✅ **FlowExecutor Integration**: Successfully utilized existing `FlowExecutor` class with significantly improved coverage
- ✅ **Execution Context Setup**: Proper execution contexts with inputs and variables working correctly
- ✅ **Result Capture**: Flows run and capture final state for comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Integration Testing**: Executors work correctly with loaded system components (tables, models, compendiums)
- ✅ **Namespace Isolation Architecture**: Implemented UUID-based flow execution namespaces to prevent data collision
- ✅ **Action Format Support**: Enhanced executors to handle both `{type: "set_value", data: {...}}` and legacy action formats
- ✅ **Template Resolution**: Namespace-aware template resolution with proper context layering

#### Key Architectural Improvements:

- ✅ **Flow Namespace Isolation**: UUID-based execution namespaces (`flow_<execution_id>`) prevent data collision between concurrent flows
- ✅ **Enhanced ExecutionContext**: Added `flow_namespaces`, `current_flow_namespace`, and namespace management methods
- ✅ **Namespace-Aware Executors**: Updated TableExecutor, DiceExecutor, and FlowExecutor to use `set_namespaced_value`
- ✅ **Engine Action Processing**: Enhanced GrimoireEngine with dual action format parsing and namespace isolation
- ✅ **Automatic Output Management**: Namespace-aware output copying from flow namespaces to root level after execution

#### Focus Areas (COMPLETED):

- ✅ **End-to-End Validation**: Successfully bridged the gap between definition and execution testing
- ✅ **Output Verification**: Flows produce expected results in practice with proper namespace isolation
- ✅ **Action Validation**: Step actions perform their intended operations without collision
- ✅ **System Integration**: Flows work correctly with tables, models, and compendiums during execution
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Validated execution error scenarios and recovery with robust input handling

#### Implementation Results:

- ✅ **Complete Flow Testing**: Successfully bridged definition testing with actual execution validation
- ✅ **Execution Engine Coverage**: Significantly improved coverage of executor components
- ✅ **Real-World Validation**: Flows work as intended with proper isolation, not just parse correctly
- ✅ **Integration Confidence**: All system components work together during execution with namespace safety
- ✅ **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive execution testing catches issues that definition tests cannot detect

## Current Statistics

### Overall Progress

- **Total Tests**: 128 (126 passing, 2 skipped)

- **Phase 1.3.1**: 19/19 tests ✅ (Enhanced table entry types with comprehensive functionality)
- **Phase 1.4**: 26/26 tests ✅ (Flow definitions: 73% coverage with comprehensive step type coverage)
- **Phase 1.4.1**: 19/19 tests ✅ (Flow execution testing: 37% executor coverage with namespace isolation)
- **Core Components**: Strong coverage on loading and validation (82% loader, 73% flows, 66% models)
- **Execution Engine**: Good coverage with namespace isolation (43% engine, 37-58% executors)
- **Architecture Validation**: Entry type validation implemented with TDD approach
- **Advanced Features**: Table entry type system with type overrides and generation support
- **Flow System**: Complete flow definition and execution testing with namespace isolation

### Skipped Tests (Missing Implementation)

- **Custom Validation Rules**: 1 test skipped - expression evaluation not implemented
- **Model Validation Engine**: 1 test skipped - complete model validation not implemented

These skipped tests clearly document what functionality is missing and will pass once expression evaluation is implemented.

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: Derived attributes ARE fully implemented and working in the execution engine via `DerivedFieldManager` and `ObservableValue` classes. The confusion comes from the fact that `ModelDefinition` is for schema validation only - derived attribute calculation happens during flow execution, not during model validation.

- ✅ **Executors**: 22-58% coverage range - all executors enhanced with namespace isolation
- ✅ **Table/Compendium**: 38-46% coverage - structure validation and entry type systems

**Next Phase** (1.5): Source and prompt definitions

- 🎯 Target: `models/source.py` (58% → 80%+) - already well-started
- 🎯 Target: Source definition loading and validation
- 🎯 Target: Prompt template parsing and rendering
- 🎯 Target: Overall coverage 33.7% → 40%+

**Future Phases**: Executor refinement and integration testing

- **Executor Enhancement**: Improve `table_executor.py` (22%), `flow_executor.py` (37%), `choice_executor.py` (15%)
- **Integration testing** will cover remaining executor edge cases and cross-component validation
- **UI components** remain low priority for core engine validation (0% coverage acceptable)
- **Target**: 45%+ overall coverage with all core execution paths well-tested

### Code Quality Improvements

**Phase 1.4.1 Major Enhancements**:

- ✅ **Flow Namespace Isolation**: UUID-based execution namespaces prevent data collision
- ✅ **Enhanced ExecutionContext**: Flow namespace management with automatic cleanup
- ✅ **Dual Action Format Support**: Backward compatible action parsing in all executors
- ✅ **Template Resolution**: Namespace-aware template resolution with context layering
- ✅ **Execution Engine Robustness**: Comprehensive flow execution testing with proper isolation

**Previous Achievements**:

- ✅ **Enhanced AttributeDefinition**: Added missing specification fields
- ✅ **Improved SystemLoader**: Better field parsing and validation
- ✅ **Architecture Validation**: Confirmed hybrid dictionary/object approach
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust handling of malformed input
- ✅ **Entry Type Validation**: TDD implementation with comprehensive validation

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns

1. **Minimal Test Systems**: Purpose-built systems are more effective than complex examples
2. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Building foundation first prevents cascading failures
3. **Feature Isolation**: Testing individual features before integration reduces complexity
4. **Architecture Questions**: Testing revealed and resolved fundamental design decisions

### Key Insights

1. **Specification Gaps**: Testing revealed missing fields in AttributeDefinition
2. **Hybrid Approach Value**: Dictionary YAML + structured objects provides best of both worlds
3. **Test-Driven Architecture**: Tests help validate and refine architectural decisions
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Starting simple and building up reduces debugging complexity
5. **Feature-Driven Development**: Implementing user-requested features with comprehensive testing validates both specification and implementation
6. **Terminology Consistency**: Consistent naming across components improves maintainability and user experience

## Next Steps

### ✅ Phase 1.4.1: Flow Execution Tests - COMPLETED

1. **End-to-End Flow Execution**: ✅ Flows run and complete successfully with proper namespace isolation
2. **Output Validation**: ✅ `outputs.character.name` correctly set after table-flow execution with isolation
3. **Action Execution**: ✅ `set_value` actions update intended paths without collision
4. **Variable Updates**: ✅ `variables.dice_result` correctly set after dice-flow execution in isolated namespace
5. **System Integration**: ✅ Flows work correctly with tables, models, and compendiums during execution
6. **Executor Coverage**: ✅ Significantly improved coverage of `FlowExecutor` and related execution components
7. **Namespace Architecture**: ✅ Implemented UUID-based flow execution namespaces preventing data collision between concurrent flows

### Short Term (Phase 1.5: Source & Prompt Tests)

1. Source definition testing and validation
2. Prompt template parsing and rendering
3. Complete core component coverage
4. **Coverage Target**: Achieve 25%+ overall coverage with core components at 60%+

### Medium Term (Phase 2.x: Integration & Execution)

1. **Expression Engine Implementation**: Currently missing custom validation rule execution
   - TODO: Implement expression evaluation for derived attributes
   - TODO: Implement custom validation rule execution
   - Priority: High (blocks full model validation)
2. **Execution Engine Testing**: Target executor components (currently 5-20% coverage)
3. Integration testing between components
4. Real-world scenario validation
5. **Coverage Target**: 40%+ overall with execution paths well-covered
6. Performance and scalability testing
7. Full GRIMOIRE specification compliance validation

### Current Technical Debt

- **🔴 HIGH PRIORITY**: Custom validation rule execution not implemented
  - ValidationRule parsing works ✅
  - Expression evaluation missing ❌
  - Tests document current limitation with clear TODOs
- **✅ DERIVED ATTRIBUTES ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED**: Derived attribute calculation works correctly
  - DerivedFieldManager and ObservableValue classes fully functional ✅
  - Expression evaluation works in flow execution context ✅
  - Only missing expression evaluation in ModelDefinition validation context ❌
  - ModelDefinition is for schema validation only - derived calculation happens in execution engine## Conclusion

Our testing strategy is proving highly effective at building confidence in the GRIMOIRE engine while simultaneously improving code quality and architectural clarity. The bottom-up, feature-isolated approach allows for rapid development cycles while maintaining comprehensive coverage of the specification.

The systematic progression through phases ensures each component is thoroughly validated before building upon it, creating a solid foundation for the complete GRIMOIRE system.
