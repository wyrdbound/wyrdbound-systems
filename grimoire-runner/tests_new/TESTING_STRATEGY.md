# GRIMOIRE Engine Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our bottom-up, feature-isolated testing approach for the GRIMOIRE engine. The strategy focuses on building confidence through systematic testing of core functionality, starting with basic features and gradually expanding to more complex use cases.

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Start with fundamental components and2. **Improved SystemLoader**: Better field parsing and validation
- ✅ **Architecture Validation**: Confirmed hybrid dictionary/object approach
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust handling of malformed input
- ✅ **Entry Type Validation**: TDD implementation with comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Enhanced Table System**: Advanced entry type functionality with type overrides and generation support
- ✅ **Terminology Consistency**: Unified `type` field usage across table system
- ✅ **Execution Engine Enhancement**: Table executor supports complex entry formats and type resolutionld upward
- **Feature Isolation**: Test individual features in isolation before integration
- **Minimal Test Systems**: Use purpose-built minimal systems rather than complex real-world examples
- **Gradual Complexity**: Expand from simple use cases to complex scenarios
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure all GRIMOIRE specification features are tested

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Clear Dependencies**: Each phase builds on the previous, creating a clear dependency chain
2. **Fast Feedback**: Small, focused tests provide rapid feedback on changes
3. **Easy Debugging**: Isolated features make it easier to identify and fix issues
4. **Specification Validation**: Tests serve as executable specification documentation
5. **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive test suite prevents breaking existing functionality

### ✅ Phase 1.2: Model Definition Tests

**Status**: COMPLETED (26/26 tests passing, 2 skipped)

**Objective**: Comprehensive testing of model definition functionality

**Test Coverage**:

- All GRIMOIRE attribute types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `roll`, `list`, `map`
- Attribute constraints: ranges, enums, defaults
- Model inheritance via `extends`
- Validation rules and derived attributes
- Optional attributes and edge cases
- Model references and collections
- Error handling for malformed models
- **Validation rule parsing and structure**
- **Basic validation execution (type checking, range validation)**
- **Derived attribute handling (not required in instances)**

**Key Achievements**:

- Enhanced `AttributeDefinition` class with missing `of` and `optional` fields
- Updated SystemLoader to parse all specification fields
- Validated complete model definition functionality
- Established patterns for complex attribute testing

**Tests Added**: 26 tests across 6 test classes

- `TestModelInheritance`: 4 tests
- `TestValidationRules`: 3 tests
- `TestValidationExecution`: 5 tests (NEW)
- `TestModelLoadingEdgeCases`: 3 tests
- `TestModelBuilderUtility`: 2 tests

**Architecture Decisions**:

- **Kept AttributeDefinition class**: Provides type safety, validation, and IDE support over simple dictionaries
- **Hybrid approach**: YAML uses dictionaries, loader converts to structured objects
- **Comprehensive field support**: Added `of` and `optional` fields to match specification

**Critical Fixes**:

- Added missing `of` field for list/map element types

### ✅ Phase 1.3.1: Enhanced Table Entry Types

**Status**: COMPLETED (19/19 tests passing)

**Objective**: Implement and validate advanced table entry type functionality with type overrides and dynamic generation

**Test Coverage**:

- **Entry Type Declaration**: Default table-level `entry_type` for structured data
- **Type Overrides**: Individual entries can override table's `entry_type` using `type` field
- **Random Selection**: Entries like `{type: "weapon"}` for random compendium selection

## Current Statistics

### Overall Progress

- **Total Tests**: 109 (109 passing, 2 skipped)
- **Overall Code Coverage**: Enhanced focused coverage of core components
- **Phase 1.1**: 14/14 tests ✅ (System loading: 50% coverage)
- **Phase 1.2**: 26/26 tests ✅ (Model definitions: 24% coverage, 2 skipped for missing features)
- **Phase 1.3**: 22/22 tests ✅ (Tables: 39%, Compendiums: 38% coverage, 1 skipped for missing features)
- **Phase 1.3.1**: 19/19 tests ✅ (Enhanced table entry types with comprehensive functionality)
- **Phase 1.4**: 26/26 tests ✅ (Flow definitions with comprehensive step type coverage)
- **Core Components**: Well-tested loading and validation logic
- **Architecture Validation**: Entry type validation implemented with TDD approach
- **Advanced Features**: Table entry type system with type overrides and generation support
- **Flow System**: Complete flow definition testing with all step types validated

### Skipped Tests (Missing Implementation)

- **Custom Validation Rules**: 1 test skipped - expression evaluation not implemented
- **Model Validation Engine**: 1 test skipped - complete model validation not implemented

These skipped tests clearly document what functionality is missing and will pass once expression evaluation is implemented.

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: Derived attributes ARE fully implemented and working in the execution engine via `DerivedFieldManager` and `ObservableValue` classes. The confusion comes from the fact that `ModelDefinition` is for schema validation only - derived attribute calculation happens during flow execution, not during model validation.

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns

1. **Minimal Test Systems**: Purpose-built systems are more effective than complex examples
2. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Building foundation first prevents cascading failures
3. **Feature Isolation**: Testing individual features before integration reduces complexity
4. **Architecture Questions**: Testing revealed and resolved fundamental design decisions

### Key Insights

1. **Specification Gaps**: Testing revealed missing fields in AttributeDefinition
2. **Hybrid Approach Value**: Dictionary YAML + structured objects provides best of both worlds
3. **Test-Driven Architecture**: Tests help validate and refine architectural decisions
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Starting simple and building up reduces debugging complexity
5. **Feature-Driven Development**: Implementing user-requested features with comprehensive testing validates both specification and implementation
6. **Terminology Consistency**: Consistent naming across components improves maintainability and user experience

## Next Steps

### ✅ Phase 1.4: Flow Definition Tests - COMPLETED

1. **Flow Structure Testing**: ✅ Flow definition loading and validation completed (target: `models/flow.py` coverage improved)
2. **Step Definition Testing**: ✅ Comprehensive step type validation (all 6 step types tested)

### Short Term (Phase 1.5: Source & Prompt Tests)

1. Source definition testing and validation
2. Prompt template parsing and rendering
3. Complete core component coverage
4. **Coverage Target**: Achieve 25%+ overall coverage with core components at 60%+

### Medium Term (Phase 2.x: Integration & Execution)

1. **Expression Engine Implementation**: Currently missing custom validation rule execution
   - TODO: Implement expression evaluation for derived attributes
   - TODO: Implement custom validation rule execution
   - Priority: High (blocks full model validation)
2. **Execution Engine Testing**: Target executor components (currently 5-20% coverage)
3. Integration testing between components
4. Real-world scenario validation
5. **Coverage Target**: 40%+ overall with execution paths well-covered
6. Performance and scalability testing
7. Full GRIMOIRE specification compliance validation

### Current Technical Debt

- **🔴 HIGH PRIORITY**: Custom validation rule execution not implemented
  - ValidationRule parsing works ✅
  - Expression evaluation missing ❌
  - Tests document current limitation with clear TODOs
- **✅ DERIVED ATTRIBUTES ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED**: Derived attribute calculation works correctly
  - DerivedFieldManager and ObservableValue classes fully functional ✅
  - Expression evaluation works in flow execution context ✅
  - Only missing expression evaluation in ModelDefinition validation context ❌
  - ModelDefinition is for schema validation only - derived calculation happens in execution engine## Conclusion

Our testing strategy is proving highly effective at building confidence in the GRIMOIRE engine while simultaneously improving code quality and architectural clarity. The bottom-up, feature-isolated approach allows for rapid development cycles while maintaining comprehensive coverage of the specification.

The systematic progression through phases ensures each component is thoroughly validated before building upon it, creating a solid foundation for the complete GRIMOIRE system.
