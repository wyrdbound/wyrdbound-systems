# GRIMOIRE Engine Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our bottom-up, feature-isolated testing approach for the GRIMOIRE engine. The strategy focuses on building confidence through systematic testing of core functionality, starting with basic features and gradually expanding to more complex use cases.

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Start with fundamental components and2. **Improved SystemLoader**: Better field parsing and validation
- ✅ **Architecture Validation**: Confirmed hybrid dictionary/object approach
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust handling of malformed input
- ✅ **Entry Type Validation**: TDD implementation with comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Enhanced Table System**: Advanced entry type functionality with type overrides and generation support
- ✅ **Terminology Consistency**: Unified `type` field usage across table system
- ✅ **Execution Engine Enhancement**: Table executor supports complex entry formats and type resolutionld upward
- **Feature Isolation**: Test individual features in isolation before integration
- **Minimal Test Systems**: Use purpose-built minimal systems rather than complex real-world examples
- **Gradual Complexity**: Expand from simple use cases to complex scenarios
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure all GRIMOIRE specification features are tested

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Clear Dependencies**: Each phase builds on the previous, creating a clear dependency chain
2. **Fast Feedback**: Small, focused tests provide rapid feedback on changes
3. **Easy Debugging**: Isolated features make it easier to identify and fix issues
4. **Specification Validation**: Tests serve as executable specification documentation
5. **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive test suite prevents breaking existing functionality

### Skipped Tests (Missing Implementation)

- **Custom Validation Rules**: 1 test skipped - expression evaluation not implemented
- **Model Validation Engine**: 1 test skipped - complete model validation not implemented

These skipped tests clearly document what functionality is missing and will pass once expression evaluation is implemented.

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: Derived attributes ARE fully implemented and working in the execution engine via `DerivedFieldManager` and `ObservableValue` classes. The confusion comes from the fact that `ModelDefinition` is for schema validation only - derived attribute calculation happens during flow execution, not during model validation.

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns

1. **Minimal Test Systems**: Purpose-built systems are more effective than complex examples
2. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Building foundation first prevents cascading failures
3. **Feature Isolation**: Testing individual features before integration reduces complexity
4. **Architecture Questions**: Testing revealed and resolved fundamental design decisions

### Key Insights

1. **Specification Gaps**: Testing revealed missing fields in AttributeDefinition
2. **Hybrid Approach Value**: Dictionary YAML + structured objects provides best of both worlds
3. **Test-Driven Architecture**: Tests help validate and refine architectural decisions
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Starting simple and building up reduces debugging complexity
5. **Feature-Driven Development**: Implementing user-requested features with comprehensive testing validates both specification and implementation
6. **Terminology Consistency**: Consistent naming across components improves maintainability and user experience

## Next Steps

### ✅ Phase 1.4.1: Flow Execution Tests - COMPLETED

2. **Output Validation**: ✅ `outputs.character.name` correctly set after table-flow execution with isolation
3. **Action Execution**: ✅ `set_value` actions update intended paths without collision
4. **Variable Updates**: ✅ `variables.dice_result` correctly set after dice-flow execution in isolated namespace
5. **System Integration**: ✅ Flows work correctly with tables, models, and compendiums during execution
6. **Executor Coverage**: ✅ Significantly improved coverage of `FlowExecutor` and related execution components
7. **Namespace Architecture**: ✅ Implemented UUID-based flow execution namespaces preventing data collision between concurrent flows

### Short Term (Phase 2.x: Integration Testing & Executor Enhancement)

1. Cross-component integration testing and validation
2. Executor enhancement and edge case coverage improvement
3. Real-world scenario testing with complex systems
4. **Coverage Target**: Achieve 45%+ overall coverage with executors at 60%+

### Medium Term (Phase 2.x: Integration & Execution)

1. **Expression Engine Implementation**: Currently missing custom validation rule execution
   - TODO: Implement expression evaluation for derived attributes
   - TODO: Implement custom validation rule execution
   - Priority: High (blocks full model validation)
2. **Execution Engine Testing**: Target executor components (currently 5-20% coverage)
3. Integration testing between components
4. Real-world scenario validation
5. **Coverage Target**: 40%+ overall with execution paths well-covered
6. Performance and scalability testing
7. Full GRIMOIRE specification compliance validation

### Current Technical Debt

- **🔴 HIGH PRIORITY**: Custom validation rule execution not implemented
  - ValidationRule parsing works ✅
  - Expression evaluation missing ❌
  - Tests document current limitation with clear TODOs
- **✅ DERIVED ATTRIBUTES ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED**: Derived attribute calculation works correctly
  - DerivedFieldManager and ObservableValue classes fully functional ✅
  - Expression evaluation works in flow execution context ✅
  - Only missing expression evaluation in ModelDefinition validation context ❌
  - ModelDefinition is for schema validation only - derived calculation happens in execution engine## Conclusion

Our testing strategy is proving highly effective at building confidence in the GRIMOIRE engine while simultaneously improving code quality and architectural clarity. The bottom-up, feature-isolated approach allows for rapid development cycles while maintaining comprehensive coverage of the specification.

The systematic progression through phases ensures each component is thoroughly validated before building upon it, creating a solid foundation for the complete GRIMOIRE system.
