  EXAMPLE 1:
  Name: Silas "Moss" Blackwood
  Gender: Male
  Physique: Scrawny
  Face: Square
  Skin: Oily
  Hair: Wispy
  Clothing: Undersized
  Virtue: Cautious
  Vice: Cowardly
  Speech: Precise
  Background: Herbalist
  Misfortunes: Mutilated
  Alignment: Neutrality

  Silas “Moss” Blackwood is a unsettling figure - a wisp of a man perpetually slick with an unnatural oiliness clinging to his square face. His wispy, dark hair drifts around him, a constant reminder of the accident that shattered his confidence. Once a promising apprentice herbalist, a misfired concoction left him grotesquely mutilated and profoundly cautious. Now, his undersized clothing hangs on his lean frame, reflecting his shrinking world. He speaks with unnerving precision, a habit from his training, often in a hushed tone. Driven by crippling cowardice, Silas avoids confrontation, seeking only to drift through the world. His meticulous observation is born of fear, a desperate attempt to control a world that feels overwhelmingly dangerous.

  =============================
  EXAMPLE 2
  Name: Zimia
  Gender: Female
  Physique: Ripped
  Face: Chiseled
  Skin: Birthmark
  Hair: Cropped
  Clothing: Bloody
  Virtue: Ambitious
  Vice: Lazy
  Speech: Quaint
  Background: Mariner
  Misfortunes: Haunted
  Alignment: Law

  Zimia cuts a striking, almost intimidating figure - a woman of formidable muscle beneath worn, bloody clothing. Her face is a landscape of sharp angles and a prominent birthmark, framing eyes that hold a disconcerting mix of steel and weariness. A former mariner, she now drifts through the world, restless and ambitious, driven by a desire to rise above her circumstances. Despite her lofty goals, a fundamental laziness often undermines her efforts, a frustrating paradox. Her speech is oddly quaint, a curious blend of archaic phrasing and blunt honesty. Haunted by a past she rarely speaks of, she clings to a rigid sense of law, seeking order in a chaotic world - though her methods are frequently unorthodox and her commitment wavering.
