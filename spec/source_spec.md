# GRIMOIRE Source Definition Specification

## Overview

Source Definition files provide metadata about the original rulebooks, supplements, or other materials that game content is derived from. They serve as bibliographic references that track the provenance of models, tables, compendiums, and other system content. This enables proper attribution and helps organize content by its source material.

Source files act as a registry of the books, PDFs, websites, or other materials that contribute content to a GRIMOIRE system.

## File Structure

All source definition files must follow this top-level structure:

```yaml
id: "unique_source_identifier"
kind: "source"
name: "Human Readable Source Name"
description: "Description of the source material"
edition: "Edition or Version"
publisher: "Publishing Company"
source_url: "https://example.com/source"
isbn: "978-0-123456-78-9" # optional
publication_date: "2023" # optional
authors: [] # optional
license: "License Type" # optional
```

## File Naming and Location

- **Filename**: Descriptive name with `.yaml` extension
- **Location**: `sources/` subdirectory within the system directory

- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names that reflect the source material

## Example

```yaml

name: "Player's Handbook"
description: "The essential rules and character options for players"
edition: "5th Edition"
publisher: "Wizards of the Coast"

## Integration with System

### Default Source

Systems can specify a default source in their `system.yaml`:

```yaml
# system.yaml
id: "my-rpg"
kind: "system"
name: "My RPG System"
default_source: "core-rulebook"
# ...
```

### Source Validation

When content references a source, the system validates:

1. The referenced source exists
2. The source ID matches an existing source file
3. The source file is valid and properly formatted

### Content Organization

Sources help organize content by:

- **Attribution**: Proper credit to original creators
- **Filtering**: Show only content from specific sources
- **Licensing**: Track usage rights and restrictions
- **Updates**: Identify content that needs updates when sources change

## Validation Rules

1. The `id` field must be unique within the system
2. The `kind` field must exactly match `"source"`
3. The `name` field is required and should be descriptive
4. URLs in `source_url` should be valid HTTP/HTTPS links
5. ISBN numbers should follow proper ISBN format if provided
6. Publication dates should use consistent formatting
7. The file must be valid YAML syntax
